To start our app we have our directory publicly listed on Google Code.
The link to get our repo is https://code.google.com/p/cs638-org-organizer/
To run our app make sure Rails 3.2.2 and Ruby 1.9.3 are installed on the local machine
We also require a postgresql server version at least 9.1.
Way to get our app running:
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rails s (our server is defaulted on http://0.0.0.0:3000
Tests can be run using the command ‘bundle exec rssec spec/controllers’

We require a user in order to use our web app, which can be created with the following commands:
1. Type 'rails console' into the terminal
2. use the following command: @user = User.new(:first_name => "Charles", :last_name => "Barkley", :email => "cbarkley@tnt.com", :password => "123456", :admin => 1)
3. use command @user.save
To login you will need the email and password (cbarkley@tnt.com password: 123456)
